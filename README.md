# EDA-and-Visualization-of-flu-data-in-US
All the python notebooks are already executed and the inputs used for the data visualization are present in the respective folders. Jupyter Notebook is needed to view the ipython files. Just download the ipython notebooks and view the data visualization by launching the jupyter notebook via anaconda. All the graphs are saved and stored in the same folder for reference, respectively.

## Part1/chaudhar_Lab1Part1.ipynb
Contains sample code for getting started with R programming language, using their dataset, importing files, demonstrating ggplot, maptools etc

## Part2/chaudhar_lab1_part2.ipynb
Seasonal Flu data of 2017-2018 was collected from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html) and based on the data, data visualizations were made using ggplot. Graphs are available in Part2 folder.

## Part3/lab1part3 (Twitter)
The heat map generated from the CDS data reported by Data based on U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network was compared with the real time twitter data. Tweets based on tags were collected along with their location data using the rtweet package and same heat map was generated and compared. The tags used for retrieving the tweets were flu, flu sick, flu Fatigue, flu fever, influenza etc. The results were displayed using Rshiny app.
